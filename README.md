### 1. Implementation of the Checklist: Step-by-Step üìù
#### ‚úîÔ∏èCreate a new Django project.
- Create a new directory with the name ```"goth-store"```
- Open the terminal and create a virtual environment inside the directory by running this command below
    ```
    python3 -m venv env
    ```
- And activate it by
    ```
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```
- Create a file named requirements.txt inside the directory and fill it with some dependencies below
    ```
    django
    gunicorn
    whitenoise
    psycopg2-binary
    requests
    urllib3
    ```
- then, install them by running this command
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Finally, create a Django project named goth-store by running the following command
    ```
    django-admin startproject goth_store .
    ```
- In ```settings.py```, add this following line of code to allow local host
    ```
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]`
    ```
#### ‚úîÔ∏èCreate an application with the name main in the project.
- Create a new application called main within the goth_store project by running this command
    ```
    python3 manage.py startapp main
    ```
- To register the main app, open the ```settings.py``` file located inside the goth_store project directory. Add ```'main'``` to the ```INSTALLED_APPS``` list, as shown below.
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'main'
    ]
    ```
#### ‚úîÔ∏èPerform routing in the project so that the application main can run
- Open the ```urls.py``` file inside the ```goth_store``` project and fill it with the code below. 
    ```
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path, include

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', include('main.urls')),
    ]
#### ‚úîÔ∏èCreate a model in the application main with the name Product and have the mandatory attributes
- In ```main/models.py```, define the Product model with the attributes name, price, and description
    ```
    from django.db import models

    class Product(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        price = models.IntegerField()
        description = models.TextField()
        gothness = models.IntegerField()
    ```
- After creating the model, run migrations to apply the changes to the database:
    ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
#### ‚úîÔ∏èCreate a function in ```views.py```to return to an HTML template that displays the name of the application and your name and class
- In ```main/views.py```, create a function that returns an HTML template:
    ```
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def show_main(request):
        context = {
            'app_name': 'goth-store',
            'name': 'Kezia Salsalina Agtyra Sebayang',
            'class': 'PBD KKI'
        }

        return render(request, 'main.html', context)
    ```
- Create a ```template``` directory inside the ```main``` application directory and add a new file called ```main.html```. Then fill it with the codes below
    ```
    <h1>{{ app_name }} </h1>
    <h5>Name: </h5>
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
    <h5>Class: </h5>
    <p>{{ class }}</p>
    ```
#### ‚úîÔ∏èCreate a routing in ```urls.py``` for the application ```main ```to map the function created in ```views.py```.
- Create a ```urls.py``` file for the main app. Here's how my ```main/urls.py``` look:
    ```
    from django.urls import path
    from main.views import show_main

    app_name = 'main'

    urlpatterns = [
        path('', show_main, name='show_main'),
    ]
    ```
#### ‚úîÔ∏èPerform deployment to PWS for the application that has been created so that it can be accessed by others via the Internet.
- Before deploying, create a new public GitHub repository named goth-store. Then, initialize the local directory goth-store as a Git repository.
- After making sure local repository is connected to the GitHub, do a add, commit, and push
- For deployment, create a PWS project named gothstore. Then add ```kezia-salsalina-gothstore.pbp.cs.ui.ac.id``` to ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` in ```settings.py```. 
- Finally, use the ```push``` command to push it to the PWS repository for the deployment.
